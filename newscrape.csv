**  About the Local Area (E14, Poplar & Docklands)**

You’re in Poplar, within the Borough of Tower Hamlets—about 5 miles east of central London.  
It’s a vibrant district anchored by Chrisp Street Market, a lively, community-centred market with shops and cafes, originally built in 1951.  

This corner of E14 benefits from a mix of residential development and Docklands history:
	•	A fusion of local town vibe in Poplar and dramatic modernity around Canary Wharf and Limehouse.   
	•	Rich connections via DLR, Jubilee Line (at Canary Wharf), and easy walking distance to multiple stations.  
	•	Amenities include local pubs, independent cafes, riverside walks in Limehouse, and shopping at Canary Wharf.  
	•	A welcoming, evolving neighbourhood: practical, refreshing, and not overly touristy.

⸻

**  Summary at a Glance**
	•	Large, modern ensuite room, all utilities covered
	•	Perfect for an individual
	•	Excellent public transport links (bus, DLR, rail)
	•	Rich and varied neighbourhood—market squares, rivers, and green regeneration all around
