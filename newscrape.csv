1 double room
2 single rooms
1 single room with its own small garden access

Shared kitchen and bathroom(s), tidy and well maintained.

Large shared kitchen / communal space — great for socialising but also plenty of privacy in your own bedroom.

Garden-access room available for someone who values a bit of outdoor space (rare in city-flat shares).

Ground-floor layout makes moving in / out easier — no upstairs climbing.

The closest Tube station is Harlesden Tube Station — approximately a 7–10 minute walk from Wesley Avenue.

Good public transport links also via Willesden Junction station and nearby Overground services.

Local amenities within easy reach: convenience shops, GPs / health-care, dental and optician services are all nearby.

For essentials: supermarkets, a range of shops, cafés and local services in Harlesden / Willesden within a short walk or bus ride.

We’re looking for friendly, responsible, clean and considerate flatmates — students or working professionals who value a quiet and respectful shared living environment. We encourage a sociable but low-key atmosphere; people who are easygoing and respectful of shared spaces.
